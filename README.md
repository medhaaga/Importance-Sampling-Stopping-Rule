# Importance-Sampling-Stopping-Rule

This repository contains reproducible examples and simulations in the "A principled stopping rule for importance sampling" by [Agarwal, Vats, and Elvira (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13289) paper. The examples include:

#### Multivariate Normal Model
#### Weibull Multi-Step Step-Stress Model
#### Bayesian Lasso with Importance Sampling and INLA

Each example folder contains the code for simulating R objects and producing plots. The objects and plots are saved in the "./Out" folder.
